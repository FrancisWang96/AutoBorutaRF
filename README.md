# AutoBorutaRF R source code
AutoBorutaRF is a program by using Autoencoder network and Boruta algorithm for feature selection and random forest for classification to build drug response prediction model.

## Computational procedure
The computational procedure implemented in AutoBorutaRF is aimed to identify the genetic features responsible for drug response classification and predict the drug response. The procedure includes two steps:
1. Selecting the genetic features
2. Predicting the drug response

These two steps use AutoencoderBoruta.R and RandomForest.R functions respectively.

### AutoencoderBoruta.R
AutoencoderBoruta.R is a two-stepwise feature selection function using the autoencoder network and Boruta algorithm to identify the genetic features responsible for drug response.
 
#### Input files:   
class.csv 
(class.csv is the category label file containing a binary-valued matrix, with rows representing samples and columns representing drugs. The element in row i and column j is "1" if sample i is "sensitive" for drug j, "0" if "non-sensitive".) 

rna.csv
(rna.csv contains the gene expression feature matrix, with rows representing samples and columns representing genes. The elements in the gene expression feature matrix are real-valued.)

cnv.csv
(cnv.csv contains the gene copy number alteration feature matrix, with rows representing samples and columns representing genes. The elements in the gene copy number alteration feature matrix are real-valued.)

mut.csv
(mut.csv contains the gene mutation feature matrix, with rows representing samples and columns representing genes. The elements in the gene mutation feature matrix are binary-valued, "1" for mutation and "0" for wild type.)

#### Output files:
predictor.csv
(predictor.csv contains the selected features, with rows representing drugs. The first element in every row is the drug name, the rest are selected features of the drug.)

### RandomForest.R is a classifier using features selected by AutoencoderBoruta.R  
RandomForest.R is a classification function to predict drug response using ten-fold cross-validation.

#### Input file:  
predictor.csv (output by AutoBorutaRF.R)

#### Output files: 
resultTable.csv
(resultTable.csv contains the classification results of ten-fold cross-validation including the Accuracy, AUC, MCC, Recall, Specificity, and so on.)

confusionMatrix.csv
(confusionMatrix.csv contains the confusion matrices of ten-fold cross-validation of drugs.)

### Example
An example run is:

First, set "dataSource <- 'GDSClung'" in AutoencoderBoruta.R function to use "GDSClung dataset" to identify the genetic features.

Second, set "dataSource <- 'GDSClung'" in RandomForest.R function to use the selected features of "GDSClung dataset" to predict drug response.
